## ✨ The Experience (Features)

* Interactive 3D Canvas: Real-time 3D rendering of the Lexus LX 700h using React Three Fiber, complete with premium studio lighting and dynamic orbit controls.
* Cinematic Scroll Mechanics: Smart implementation of the IntersectionObserver API to seamlessly play, pause, and control background video muting based on viewport proximity.
* Master Craftsmanship Typography: Custom-built typewriter reveal effects (TypewriterText) that trigger precisely when elements enter the screen, mimicking high-end video production.
* Absolute Minimalist UI/UX: A dark-mode-exclusive interface inspired by elite automotive design, featuring custom luxury loading spinners and elegant serif typography.
* Smart Asset Caching: A custom XHR preloader for massive media assets ensures buttery-smooth playback and transitions before the user even begins their journey.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

To maintain a clean and scalable codebase, the project is structured by separating the 3D WebGL environment from the DOM overlay elements.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
​The Canvas/DOM Separation: By fixing the <Canvas> to the background and allowing the HTML <Overlay> to scroll naturally on top with pointer-events: none/auto, we achieve a flawless interaction where mouse scrolls bypass the DOM to rotate the 3D car only where intended.
​Intersection Observers: Videos and heavy animations are not triggered until they are exactly within the user's viewport, saving massive amounts of memory and ensuring smooth framerates (60FPS).
